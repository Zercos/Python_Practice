# API_request_VK
It is a API request program.

It takes one argument, user id or username.

It will return you the list of tuples, format in that way "(age of user's friend, quantity of friends with that age)".

To execute this program I used the api vk methods username_get() and friends_get(). To make a request you need to have "access token".
You can use this one "ACCESS_TOKEN = '17da724517da724517da72458517b8abce117da17da72454d235c274f1a2be5f45ee711'", it will work corectly.
Also you must have installed libraries "re" and "requests".
